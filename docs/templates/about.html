        Hi! I’m Kirsten. I’ve been called a research junkie and a learning addict.  I almost always know how to fix the copier.
      </p>

      <p class="blah-blah-me">
        Professionally, I’m intensely mission focused and driven, but I also love a grand adventure. I'm constantly delighted by how there is never a shortage of things to learn and challenges to tackle within the ever-evolving world of technology and humans.
      </p>

      <p class="blah-blah-me">
        While I indulge in shouting into the void as much as the next person, I actively listen and value doing the right thing over being right in every situation.</br></br> I’d love to learn from you.
